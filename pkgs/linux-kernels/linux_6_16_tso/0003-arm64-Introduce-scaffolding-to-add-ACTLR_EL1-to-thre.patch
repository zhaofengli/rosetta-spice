Subject: [PATCH 3/6] arm64: Introduce scaffolding to add ACTLR_EL1 to thread
 state

Some CPUs expose IMPDEF features in ACTLR_EL1 that can be meaningfully
controlled per-thread (like TSO control on Apple cores). Add the basic
scaffolding to save/restore this register as part of context switching.

This mechanism is disabled by default both by config symbol and via a
runtime check, which ensures it is never triggered unless the system is
known to need it for some feature (which also implies that the layout of
ACTLR_EL1 is uniform between all CPU core types).
